== Structure of the course ==

Philosophy: Programmers learn by scratching an itch. 

-- We have 12 lectures, you don't learn to program in that time

First 6 weeks: Getting to grips with Python syntax etc.

Second 6 weeks: Work on a specific problem.

== Tools for a programmer ==

* Search engine (google/yandex)

* Stackoverflow

* IRC

* docs.python.org

-- Copypasta is fine, and encouraged... but (1) cite, (2) think, is it faster to adjust someone else's code or write your own?


== Groups ==

Advanced: 

- Work on your own project idea 

Beginners: 

- Implement a basic NLP pipeline for a language of your choice -- let's have some variety.

raw corpus | sentence segmentation | tokenisation | transcription | part-of-speech tagging

== Weeks ==


== Projects ==

Advanced (12 weeks)

- classifier for sentence segmentation (perceptron?)

- freeness of wordorder (wordorder from dep-pos ? head-pos) UD vs. wals, e.g. see what factors influence:
     -- agreement (mod+head have same feature+val) 
     -- n.cases, 
     -- distribution e.g. (sov 90%, vos 1%) vs. (sov 50%, vos 50%)

Beginner (6 weeks)

- something with WALS
