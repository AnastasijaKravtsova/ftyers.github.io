<h3>Marking</h3>

<ul>
<li>60% Practicals</li>
<li>30% Exam</li>
<li>10% Active participation</li>
</ul>

<p>
<!--<p>
<b>Exam:</b> There will be a short exam to test you on what you have learnt in the course. There will be a number of 
  multiple choice questions and a programming assignment to complete on paper. As programming is a subject that is 
  more suited to practical evaluation the exam has a concomitantly low contribution to your final mark.
</p>-->
<p>
<b>Practicals:</b> Most of the course will be made up of practical sessions. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Exam:</b>  There will be an end of course exam which will consist of ten questions. The exam will be a take home
exam.
</p>
<p>
<b>Active participation:</b> Beyond simply showing up, I encourage you to contribute to discussions by 
asking questions, answering questions, making relevant comments, helping classmates and asking for help with in-class 
activities, etc. There are no stupid questions &mdash; I want to make sure everyone grasps the concepts, and many 
are not as straightforward as they may first seem (or as I think they are). You are also expected to have read 
any assigned readings before class.
</p>

<h3>In the classroom</h3>

<!--<p>
This course is taught mostly on computers, so we will be using computers in every class. This 
brings about the potential for a number of distractions, so please use the computer 
only for relevant classroom activities. In other words, please refrain from any 
non-class-related activities, including messaging (e-mail, social media, etc.), homework 
for other courses, etc.
</p>-->
<p>
Note on pronouns: If you'd like to be referred to by a pronoun that you think I might not
guess correctly or if you notice me referring to you by some other pronoun than what you'd prefer, 
please let me know so that I can get it right.
</p>
<p>
Note on language: If I am talking too fast, or if I use an expression that you do not understand
and you think it is having an effect on your learning, please ask me to slow down. You are 
welcome to come and talk to me at any time about issues relating to language. I will be happy 
to discuss them.
