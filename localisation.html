On this page I want to make a list of instructions for language communities who want to get their
language onto their desktops and mobile devices. What is the motivation behind this? Well,
kids are always on their phones, and so are continually exposed to whatever language those 
phones are in. As David Crystal says in his book <em>Language Death</em>: "An endangered language will progress if its speakers
can make use of electronic technology".
</p>
<p>
So the idea of this page is to give pointers to how people can make the most visible parts 
of their online experience be in their language.
</p>
<h2>Mozilla/Firefox</h2>
<p>
Mozilla products (for example Firefox, Thunderbird, etc.) are localised 
through a system called <a href="https://pontoon.mozilla.org/">Pontoon</a>. This
is a web-based system for localising strings.
</p>
<p>
In order to get localising, you need to first go to <a href="https://pontoon.mozilla.org/">Pontoon</a>, 
and check if your language is in the list at the top left. If it is in the list then great, you can skip
the next sections. If it is not in the list, then go to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mozilla.dev.l10n.new-locales">Mozilla
localisation list</a> and register.
</p>
<p>
After you have registered, post a message to the list (in English) asking for your language
to be added to Pontoon and answering the following questions:

<pre>

1) What Mozilla product are you hoping to localise? Keep in mind that
Firefox desktop is a rather large project which can potentially take a long
time for a full localisation to ship.
2) Which language code should be used? (ISO-639-1, ISO-639-3, country code).
3) How many plural forms are in the language? To give an example,
how would you translate the following phrases:

   - *0 rocks*
   - *1 rock*
   - *2 rocks*
   - *3 rocks*
   - *4 rocks *
   - *5 rocks*
   - *10 rocks*
   - *20 rocks*
   - *100 rocks*
   - *1000 rocks*
   - *I see 0 rocks on the ground*
   - *I see 1 rock on the ground*
   - *I see 10 rocks on the ground*

4) Are you hoping to localise alone or do you have friends that will join
you? For sustainability of the localisation (because we're always releasing
new versions of Firefox products that will need localising), we'd prefer to
only ship new locales that have more than one person sustaining them.
</pre>
<p>
Note that the list is moderated so you may have to wait for your request to go through.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime you can create a Firefox account at their <a href="https://accounts.firefox.com/signup">signup page</a>,
reply to the verification email, and log into <a href="https://pontoon.mozilla.org/">Pontoon</a>. There are some very
useful <a href="https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/localizer-documentation/tools/pontoon/users.html">instructions</a>.
</p>
<p>
After you have got access, you can use the Pontoon interface to translate what you want. 
The localised version will only be released when there is enough of the interface translated.
Here is some information from Mozilla about the process:

<pre>
1) We enable Pontoon and start with an unofficial repo (not hosted on hg.mozilla.org). Once the 
   locale has reached a good level of translation and participation we move to #2

2) We add an official Mercurial repository and start building Nightly for this language. There's a 
   lot of technical details to fix at this point, like creating a Bugzilla component, 
   setting up searchplugins, build system, etc. That's also the reason we introduced the first step 
   for new locales.

   At this point we also ask localisation teams to start localising mozilla.org. While it's not 
   mandatory to complete the localisation, at least some key pages should be completed to 
   promote the localised build.

3) Locale stays on Nightly for at least 1 or 2 cycles after completing key parts. It can move to 
   Beta and Release only if it a) keeps up with localisation and b) builds a group of users on the 
   Nightly channel.

4) Once in release, localisation needs to be kept up to date. That's the most boring part of the work, 
   but also the most important. That's also the main reason we try to avoid individual efforts, and 
   prefer a group of volunteers working on the localisation.

We realise that's a lot to ask for, and that not everybody will be comfortable with it, but these 
are the standards we have to meet to serve an audience of hundreds of millions of people aroung the world.
</pre>

Good luck! :)

<h2>WhatsApp</h2>
<p>
Localisation of WhatsApp can be done <a href="https://translate.whatsapp.com/">online</a>. If your language
isn't listed, you can contact WhatsApp support on <a href="mailto:translate@support.whatsapp.com">translate@support.whatsapp.com</a>,
but they might not reply. You should also try contacting <a href="mailto:android_web@support.whatsapp.com">android_web@support.whatsapp.com</a>.
</p>
<h2>Telegram</h2>
<p>
Localisation of Telegram is done through <a href="https://www.transifex.com/telegram/public/">Transifex</a>,
there are 3,715 strings to translate for the Android client, so it's not that much.
</p>
<p>
You will need to <a href="https://www.transifex.com/signup/?join_project=telegram">log in</a>. After completing
the login form, you can go to the <a href="https://www.transifex.com/telegram/telegram/">Android client</a> and
click on "Join team". You will need to wait to be approved.
</p>
<p>
While you are waiting, you can also download an XML file from <a href="https://tlgrm.ru/locales/list#android">their site</a> and start translating.
You can then take the XML file, send it to yourself in Telegram and then click on it to "apply localisation". There are
approximately 1,800 strings
