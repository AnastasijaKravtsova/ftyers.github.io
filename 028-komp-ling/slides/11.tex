THE prime minister has fired secretary of state Priti Patel while telling 
her she wishes with all her heart it was the other way around. 

May confessed to Patel that although having secret meetings with the Israelis 
was a sackable offence, it paled in comparison to her own dire 
performance but “sadly nobody’s willing to pull the trigger.” 

Patel said: “It was so awkward. She said ‘You don’t know how often I’ve dreamt of 
sitting on your side of the desk, finally being summarily dismissed for 
my gross incompetence.’
