<h2>079 | Основы программировани</h2>

<h3> Description </h3>

A gentle introduction to corpus processing and programming for computational linguists. The course
is structured in two parts, the first six weeks is familiarisation with programming in Python
and the UNIX shell, the second six weeks is implementing a program of your choice to solve a personal
need related to linguistics or natural-language processing.

Every week we will do a short lecture where I will introduce some concepts, and then the remainder 
of the course will be practical work &mdash; that is, programming. 

<h3> Course objectives </h3>

By the end of this course you should be:
<ul>
<li> familiar with the syntax of the Python programming language</li>
<li> able to navigate the filesystem using the UNIX shell</li>
<li> capable of efficiently using online resources to guide your own learning</li>
<li> able to use Python to process corpora from the web</li>
<li> able to use Python to implement a simple NLP pipeline from scratch</li>
</ul>


<h3> Lectures and practicals </h3>

<h4> Week 1</h4>

<p>
<b>Preparation:</b> Get some sleep, prepare for excitement.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Install Python</li>
<li>Where to get help ? Google, Stackoverflow, IRC, docs.python.org</li>
<li>Pipelines in UNIX</li>
<li>Processing Wikipedia dumps</li>
<li>Basic structure of a program</li>
<li>Programming patterns for input/output (stdin, stdout)</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Practical:</b> Download and extract a Wikipedia dump for a language of your choice.
</p>
<p>
<b>Homework:</b> Use a standard UNIX utility to count the number of lines, words and characters in your corpus.
</p>

<h4> Week 2</h4>

<p>
<b>Preparation:</b> Read the informal introduction to Python, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html">here</a>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Continue with basic structure of programs</li>
<li>Variables</li>
<li>Arithmetic in Python</li>
<li>Loops and flow control</li>
<li>String processing</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Practical:</b> Write a simple sentence segmenter in Python for the corpus you have created.
</p>

<p>
<b>Homework:</b> Write your own program in Python to count the number of lines, words and 
characters in your corpus. Compare the results with the output of the UNIX tool.
</p>

<h4> Week 3</h4>

<p>
<b>Preparation:</b>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Character encoding and special characters</li>
<li>Lists</li>
<li>Formatting output using <tt>print()</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Practical:</b> Write a basic tokeniser that takes the output of the sentence segmenter
and outputs the tokens one per line with token ids.
</p>

<p>
<b>Homework:</b> Improve the segmenter and tokeniser to take into account more cases. Annotate ten
sentences from your corpus for part-of-speech tags.
</p>

<h4> Week 4</h4>

<p>
<b>Preparation:</b> Read about the dictionary type, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries">here</a>
</p>

<ul>
<li>The dict datastructure</li>
<li>Integers and floats</li>
<li>File input/output</li>
<li>Functions</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Practical:</b> Write a program to either transliterate or transcribe the sentences in your corpus
</p>

<p>
<b>Homework:</b> Annotate 20 sentences from your corpus for part-of-speech
</p>


<h4> Week 5</h4>

<p>
<b>Preparation:</b>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Passing arguments from the command line</li>
<li>Type conversion</li>
<li>Sorting lists and dicts</li>
<li>Tuples</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Practical:</b> Write a program to calculate a unigram language model from your tagged corpus
</p>

<p>
<b>Homework:</b> 
</p>

<h4> Week 6</h4>

<p>
<b>Preparation:</b>
</p>


<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Practical:</b> Write a unigram tagger that operates in the pipeline with your segmenter and tokeniser
</p>

<p>
<b>Homework:</b> Make a number of improvements to your tagger based on rules that you come up with.
</p>

<h3>Marking</h3>

<ul>
<li>40% Project</li>
<li>20% Exam</li>
<li>15% Practicals</li>
<li>15% Homework</li>
<li>10% Active participation</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Project:</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Exam:</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Practicals:</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Homework:</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Active participation:</b> Beyond simply showing up, I encourage you to contribute to discussions by 
asking questions, answering questions, making relevant comments, helping classmates and asking for help with in-class 
activities, etc. There are no stupid questions &mdash; I want to make sure everyone grasps the concepts, and many 
are not as straightforward as they may first seem (or as I think they are). You are also expected to have read 
any assigned readings before class.
</p>

<!--
I also encourage you to engage in relevant discussion electronically as well &mdash; e.g., via or in issues posted on GitHub. The course will also have an IRC channel, which you're encouraged to be logged into when you can. This is a good way to get help from your classmates (and your professor!) outside of class. -->

<h3>In the classroom</h3>

<!--<p>
This course is taught mostly on computers, so we will be using computers in every class. This 
brings about the potential for a number of distractions, so please use the computer 
only for relevant classroom activities. In other words, please refrain from any 
non-class-related activities, including messaging (e-mail, social media, etc.), homework 
for other courses, etc.
</p>-->
<p>
Note on pronouns: If you'd like to be referred to by a pronoun that you think I might not
guess correctly or if you notice me referring to you by some other pronoun than what you'd prefer, 
please let me know so that I can get it right.
