<h2>079 | Основы программирования</h2>

<h3> Description </h3>

A gentle introduction to corpus processing and programming for computational linguists. The course
is structured in two parts, the first six weeks is familiarisation with programming in Python
and the UNIX shell, the second six weeks is implementing a program of your choice to solve a personal
need related to linguistics or natural-language processing.

Every week we will do a short lecture where I will introduce some concepts, and then the remainder 
of the course will be practical work &mdash; that is, programming. 

<h3> Course objectives </h3>

By the end of this course you should be:
<ul>
<li> familiar with the syntax of the Python programming language</li>
<li> able to navigate the filesystem using the UNIX shell</li>
<li> capable of efficiently using online resources to guide your own learning</li>
<li> able to use Python to process corpora from the web</li>
<li> able to use Python to implement a simple NLP pipeline from scratch</li>
</ul>

<h3> Groups </h3>

As some of the people taking the class may have prior programming experience, the class will be
split into two groups. 

The first group will be beginners who have no or very little previous 
programming experience. This group will follow the lectures and do the practicals. 

The second group are those who have prior experience and are fairly confident with programming. 
These students will work independently on their own project for the duration of the course.

<h3>Marking</h3>

<ul>
<li>40% Project</li>
<li>10% Exam</li>
<li>20% Practicals</li>
<li>20% Homework</li>
<li>10% Active participation</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Project:</b> The project will encompass all of the class work and homework for the last six classes. You should 
  start thinking from the first class what you might be interested in working on. If you cannot come up with any
  ideas, then I will give a number of options, or come and talk to me. The project should be substantial and test 
  and expand your knowledge in some way. It should contain an evaluation component, either for efficiency of implementation
  or in terms of accuracy for some task. It will include a short (maximum ten minute) presentation to be done on the last
  day of class. One of the most important aspects of programming is learning to use the computer 
  to <em>scratch an itch</em> `удовлетворить личное желание' the project will ensure you are able to do that.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exam:</b> There will be a short exam to test you on what you have learnt in the course. There will be a number of 
  multiple choice questions and a programming assignment to complete on paper. As programming is a subject that is 
  more suited to practical evaluation the exam has a concomitantly low contribution to your final mark.
</p>
<p>
<b>Practicals:</b> Most of the course will be made up of practical sessions. I will evaluate your progress
after each session.
</p>
<p>
<b>Homework:</b> Homework will be submitted through Github, and will need to be completed before the following 
lesson. Your Github repository should be called <tt>2017-osnov_programm</tt> and have the following subdirectories:
<tt>corpus</tt> for your (sub-)corpus from Wikipedia, and <tt>project</tt> for your project work.
</p>
<p>
<b>Active participation:</b> Beyond simply showing up, I encourage you to contribute to discussions by 
asking questions, answering questions, making relevant comments, helping classmates and asking for help with in-class 
activities, etc. There are no stupid questions &mdash; I want to make sure everyone grasps the concepts, and many 
are not as straightforward as they may first seem (or as I think they are). You are also expected to have read 
any assigned readings before class.
</p>

<!--
I also encourage you to engage in relevant discussion electronically as well &mdash; e.g., via or in issues posted on GitHub. The course will also have an IRC channel, which you're encouraged to be logged into when you can. This is a good way to get help from your classmates (and your professor!) outside of class. -->

<h3> Project ideas </h3>

As the project will take up approximately 22 hours of work time (16 hours of class time and 6 hours of homework time), it should 
be sufficiently in depth to fill the time.

<ul>
  <li> Implement a system from a paper you like </li>
  <li> Write one of the components of the pipeline (segmenter, tokeniser, transcription, tagger) using a machine learning technique (perceptron, naïve Bayes)</li>
  <li> Do an experiment using data from the treebanks in Universal Dependencies (for example look at factors that influence word order)</li>
  <li> Do an experiment using the World Atlas of Linguistic Structures (WALS) 
  <li> Write a program to classify words in a particular language by declension class </li>
  <li> Write a program to convert between two tagsets, e.g. <tt>mystem</tt> and Universal Dependencies </li>
  <li> ... </li>
</ul>

<h3>In the classroom</h3>

<!--<p>
This course is taught mostly on computers, so we will be using computers in every class. This 
brings about the potential for a number of distractions, so please use the computer 
only for relevant classroom activities. In other words, please refrain from any 
non-class-related activities, including messaging (e-mail, social media, etc.), homework 
for other courses, etc.
</p>-->
<p>
Note on pronouns: If you'd like to be referred to by a pronoun that you think I might not
guess correctly or if you notice me referring to you by some other pronoun than what you'd prefer, 
please let me know so that I can get it right.
</p>
<p>
Note on language: If I am talking too fast, or if I use an expression that you do not understand
and you think it is having an effect on your learning, please ask me to slow down. You are 
welcome to come and talk to me at any time about issues relating to language. I will be happy 
to discuss them.
