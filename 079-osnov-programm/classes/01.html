Text is available like never before. Data collection efforts such as the Association for Computational
Linguistics' Data Collection Initiative (ACL/DCI), the Consortium for Lexical Research (CLR), the
European Corpus Initiative (ECI), ICAME, the British National Corpus (BNC), the Linguistic Data
Consortium (LDC), Electronic Dictionary Research (EDR) and many others have done a wonderful job in
acquiring and distributing dictionaries and corpora. 1 In addition, there are vast quantities of so-called
Information Super Highway Roadkill: email, bboards, faxes. We now has access to billions and billions of
words, and even more pixels.
</p>
<p>
What can we do with it all? Now that data collection efforts have done such a wonderful service to the
community, many researchers have more data than they know what to do with. Electronic bboards are
beginning to fill up with requests for word frequency counts, ngram statistics, and so on. Many researchers
believe that they don't have sufficient computing resources to do these things for themselves. Over the
years, I've spent a fair bit of time designing and coding a set of fancy corpus tools for very large corpora
(eg, billions of words), but for a mere million words or so, it really isn't worth the effort. You can almost
certainly do it yourself, even on a modest PC. People used to do these kinds of calculations on a PDP-11,
which is much more modest in almost every respect than whatever computing resources you are currently
using.
</p>
<p>I wouldn't bring out the big guns (fancy machines, fancy algorithms, data collection committees, bigtime
favors) unless you have a lot of text (e.g., hundreds of million words or more), or you are trying to count
really long ngrams (e.g., 50-grams). This chapter will describe a set of simple Unix-based tools that should
be more than adequate for counting trigrams on a corpus the size of the Brown Corpus. I'd recommend that
you do it yourself for basically the same reason that home repair stores like DIY and Home Depot are as
popular as they are. You can always hire a pro to fix your home for you, but a lot of people find that it is
better not to, unless they are trying to do something moderately hard. Hamming used to say it is much
better to solve the right problem naively than the wrong problem expertly.
</p>
<p>
I am very much a believer in teaching by examples. George Miller (personal communication) has observed
that dictionary definitions are often not as helpful as example sentences. Definitions make a lot of sense if
you already basically know what the word means, but they can be hard going if you have never seen the
word before. Following this spirit, this chapter will focus on examples and avoid definitions whenever
possible. In some cases, I will deliberately use new options and even new commands without defining
them first. The reader is encouraged to try the examples themselves, and when all else fails consult the
documentation. (But hopefully, that shouldn't be necessary too often, since we all know how boring the
documentation can be.)</p>

We will show how to solve the following exercises using only very simple utilities.

<ol>
<li>Count words in a text</li>
<li>
Sort a list of words in various ways
<ul>
<li>ascii order</li>
<li>dictionary order</li>
<li>''rhyming'' order</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compute ngram statistics</li>
<li> Make a Concordance</li>
</ol>

The code fragments in this chapter were developed and tested on a Sun computer running Berkeley Unix.
The code ought to work on more or less as is in any Unix system, and even in many PC environments,
running various compatibility packages such as the MKS toolkit.

<h3>Count words in a text</h3>

The problem is to input a text file, say Wikipedia (a good place to start), and output a list of words in the file
along with their frequency counts. The algorithm consists of three steps:

<ol>
<li>Tokenise the text into a sequence of words (tr),</li>
<li>Sort the words (sort), and</li>
<li>Count duplicates (uniq -c).</li>
</ol>

The algorithm can be implemented in just three lines of Unix code:

<pre>
sed 's/[^а-яА-ЯI]\+/\n/g' < wiki.txt |
sort -r |
uniq -c > wiki.hist
</pre>

This program produces the following output:

<pre>
      5 Яшар
      1 яшавалда
     17 яшав
      1 ячуна
      1 Ячун
      6 ячун
      1 ячула
      1 ячинчIого
      1 ячинчIей
      2 ячине
...
</pre>

<p>
<div style="color:grey">
<b>WARNING:</b> In some Unix™ environments you should use <tt>gsed</tt> instead of <tt>sed</tt>. If you are
getting strange output try this.
</div>
</p>

The less than symbol "&lt;" indicates that the input should be taken from the file named "wiki.txt", and the
greater than symbol "&gt;" indicates that the output should be redirected to a file named "wiki.hist". By
default, input is read from <tt>stdin</tt> (standard input) and written to <tt>stdout</tt> (standard output). Standard input is
usually the keyboard and standard output is usually the active window.

The pipe symbol "|" is used to connect the output of one program to the input of the next. In this case, tr
outputs a sequence of tokens (words) which are then piped into <tt>sort</tt>. Sort outputs a sequence of sorted
tokens which are then piped into <tt>uniq</tt>, which counts up the runs, producing the desired result.

We can understand this program better by breaking it up into smaller pieces. Lets start by looking at the
beginning of the input file. The Unix program <tt>sed</tt> can be used as follows to show the first five lines of
the wiki file:

<pre>
$ sed 5q < wiki.txt 

География:

Гъизляр:
Гъизляр яги БагIаршагьар () — Туркияб мацIалдаса магIарул мацIалде буссине гьабуни "Ясшагьар". Цебе заманалда гьениб букIун буго кIудияб лагъзал ричулеб базар. Гьениса ричун росулел (яги рикъулел) рукIун руго руччабиги, хIалтIухъабиги. 
</pre>

In the same way, we can use the same command, <tt>sed</tt>, to verify that the first few tokens generated by <tt>sed</tt> do indeed correspond to
the first few words in the wiki file.

<pre>
$ sed 's/[^а-яА-ЯI]\+/\n/g' < wiki.txt | sed 5q

География


Гъизляр

</pre>

Similarly, we can verify that the output of the <tt>sort</tt> step produces a sequence of (not necessarily distinct)
tokens in lexicographic order.

<pre>
$ sed 's/[^а-яА-ЯI]\+/\n/g' < wiki.txt | 
sort -r | 
sed 10q

Яшар
Яшар
Яшар
Яшар
Яшар
яшавалда
яшав
яшав
яшав
яшав
</pre>

Finally, the <tt>uniq</tt> step counts up the repeated tokens.

<pre>
$ sed 's/[^а-яА-ЯI]\+/\n/g' < wiki.txt | 
sort -r | 
uniq -c | 
sed 5q

      5 Яшар
      1 яшавалда
     17 яшав
      1 ячуна
      1 Ячун
</pre>

<h3>More counting exercises</h3>

<p>This section will show three variants of the counting program above to illustrate just how easy it is to count
a wide variety of (possibly) useful things. The details of the examples aren't all that important. The point
is to realize that pipelines are so powerful that they can be easily extended to count words (by almost any
definition one can imagine), ngrams, and much more.</p>

<p>The examples in this section will discuss various (weird) definitions of what is a "word". Some students
get distracted at this point by these weird definitions and lose sight of the point &mdash; that pipelines make it
relatively easy to mix and match a small number of simple programs in very powerful ways. But even
these students usually come around when they see how these very same techiques can be used to count
ngrams, which is really nothing other than yet another weird definition of what is a word/token.</p>

<p>The first of the three examples shows that a straightforward one-line modification to the counting program
can be used to merge the counts for upper and lower case. The first line in the new program below
collapses the case distinction by translating lower case to upper case:</p>

<pre>
$ uconv -x upper < wiki.txt | 
sed 's/[^А-Яа-яI]\+/\n/g' | 
sort -r | 
uniq -c | 
sed 5q
</pre>

Small changes to the tokenising rule are easy to make, and can have a dramatic impact. The second
example shows that we can count vowel sequences instead of words by changing the tokenising rule
(the <tt>sed</tt> line) to emit sequences of vowels rather than sequences of alphabetic characters.

<pre>
$ uconv -x upper < wiki.txt | 
sed 's/[^АЭИОУЯЕЫЁЮ]\+/\n/g' | 
sort -r | 
uniq -c 
</pre>

<pre>
$ uconv -x upper < wiki.txt | 
sed 's/[^БВГДЖЗЙКЛМНПРСТФХЦЧШЩЪЬ]\+/\n/g' | 
sort -r | 
uniq -c 
</pre>

<p>These three examples are intended to show how easy it is to change the definition of what counts as a word.
Sometimes you want to distinguish between upper and lower case, and sometimes you don't. Sometimes
you want to collapse morphological variants (does hostage = hostages). Different languages use different
character sets. Sometimes I get email from Sweden, for example, where "y" is a vowel. The tokeniser
depends on what you are trying to do. The same basic counting program can be used to count a variety of
different things, depending on how you implement the definition of thing (=token).</p>

<p>You can find the documentation for the <tt>sort</tt> command (and many other commands as well) by saying</p>

<pre>
$ man sort
</pre>

<p>If you want to see the document for some other command, simply replace the <tt>sort</tt> with the name of that
other command.</p>

<p>The man page for <tt>sed</tt> explains that it inputs a stream and applies various transformations depending 
on an expression, in

<pre>
sed 's/а/б/g'
</pre>

<p><tt>sed</tt> changes all instances of 'а' to 'б'. The 's' means match a pattern in the stream and replace
it with something else. The pattern and replacement are put between '/' characters, and the final 'g' means 
do this to all instances of the pattern you see in the stream. The <tt>sed</tt> command,

<pre>
sed 's/[^А-Яа-яI]\+/\n/g'
</pre>

<p>translates any non-alphabetic character to newline. Non-alphabetic characters include puctuation, white
space, control characters, etc. It is easier to refer to non-alphabetic characters by referring to their
complement because many of them (like newline) are hard to refer to (without knowing the context).</p>

<h3>Sort</h3>

<p>The sorting step can also be modified in a variety of different ways. The man page for <tt>sort</tt> describes a
number of options or flags such as:</p>

<table>
<tr><td><b>Example</b></td><td><b>Explanation</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>sort -d</tt></td><td>dictionary order</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>sort -f</tt></td><td>fold case</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>sort -n</tt></td><td>numeric order</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>sort -r</tt></td><td>reverse order</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>sort -nr</tt></td><td>reverse numeric order</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>sort -u</tt></td><td>remove duplicates</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>sort +1</tt></td><td>start with field 1 (starting from 0)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>sort +0.50</tt></td><td>start with 50th character</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>sort +1.5</tt></td><td>start with 5th character of field 1</td></tr>
</table>

These options can be used in straightforward ways to solve the following exercises:

<ol>
<li>Sort the words in Wikipedia by frequency</li>
<pre> sed 's/[^а-яА-ЯI]\+/\n/g' < wiki.txt |
sort |
uniq -c |
sort -nr
</pre>
<li>Sort them by folding case.</li>
<li>Sort them by ''rhyming'' order.</li>
</ol>

The last two examples above are left as exercises for the reader, but unlike most ''exercises for the reader,''
the solutions can be found in the appendix of this chapter.

By ''rhyming'' order, we mean that the words should be sorted from the right rather than the left, as
illustrated below:

<pre>
Гьезда
мацIалда
округалда
заманалда
Шагьаралда
севералда
къиблаялда
Федерациялда
бакъбаккуда
Бакъда
МахIачхъала
...
</pre>

<p>''севералда'' comes before ''къиблаялда'' because ''адларевес'' (''севералда'' spelled backwards) comes before ''адляалбиък''
(''къиблаялда'' spelled backwords) in lexicographic order. Rhyming dictionaries are often used to help poets
(and linguists who are interested in suffixing morphology).</p>

<p>Hint: There is a Unix command <tt>rev</tt>, which reverses the letters on a line:</p>

<pre>
$ echo "МагIарул мацI" | rev 
Iцам лураIгаМ

$ echo "МагIарул мацI" | rev  | rev 
МагIарул мацI
</pre>

<p>Thus far, we have seen how Unix commands such as <tt>sort</tt>, <tt>uniq</tt>, <tt>sed</tt> and <tt>rev</tt> can be combined into
pipelines with the ''|'', ''<,'' and ''>'' operators in simple yet powerful ways. All of the examples were
based on counting words in a text. The flexibility of the pipeline approach was illustrated by showing how
easy it was to modify the counting program to</p>

<ul>
<li>tokenise by vowel, merge upper and lower case</li>
<li>sort by frequency, rhyming order</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bigrams</h3>

<p>The same basic counting program can be modified to count bigrams (pairs of words), using the algorithm:</p>

<ol>
<li>tokenise by word</li>
<li>print <em>word_i</em> and <em>word_i+1</em> on the same line</li>
<li>count</li>
</ol>

<p>The second step makes use of two new Unix commands, <tt>tail</tt> and <tt>paste</tt>. Tail is usually used to output the
last few lines of a file, but it can be used to output all but the first few lines with the ''+2'' option. The
following code uses tail in this way to generate the files genesis.words and genesis.nextwords which
correspond to <em>word</em><sub>i</sub> and <em>word</em><sub><em>i</em>+1</sub> .</p>

<pre>
sed 's/[^а-яА-ЯI]\+/\n/g' < wiki.txt > wiki.words
tail -n +2 wiki.words > wiki.nextwords
</pre>

<p>Paste takes two files and prints them side by side on the same line. Pasting wiki.words and
wiki.nextwords together produces the appropriate input for the counting step.</p>

<pre>
paste wiki.words wiki.nextwords

...
гьениб	букIун
букIун	буго
буго	кIудияб
кIудияб	лагъзал
лагъзал	ричулеб
ричулеб	базар
базар	Гьениса
Гьениса	ричун
ричун	росулел
...
</pre>

<p>Combining the pieces, we end up with the following four line program for counting bigrams:</p>

<pre>
sed 's/[^а-яА-ЯI]\+/\n/g' < wiki.txt > wiki.words
tail -n +2 wiki.words > wiki.nextwords
paste wiki.words wiki.nextwords | sort | uniq -c > wiki.bigrams
</pre>

<p>The ten most frequent bigrams in the Avar Wikipedia are:</p>

<pre>
sort -nr < wiki.bigrams | sed 10q
   3888 	
    382 къо	
    371 	абилеб
    365 хутIула	къо
    365 сверизе	хутIула
    365 ЛъагIел	сверизе
    359 абилеб	къо
    356 лъагIалил	абилеб
    349 къо	високоснияб
    349 високоснияб	соналъ
</pre>

<p>Exercise: count trigrams. The solution can be found in the appendix.</p>

<p>I have presented this material in quite a number of tutorials over the years. The students almost always
come up with a big ''aha'' reaction at this point. Counting words seems easy enough, but for some reason,
students are almost always pleasantly surprised to discover that counting ngrams (bigrams, trigrams, 50-grams) 
is just as easy as counting words. It is just a matter of how you tokenise the text. We can tokenise
the text into words or into ngrams; it makes little difference as far as the counting step is concerned.</p>

<h3>Shell scripts</h3>

Suppose that you found that you were often computing trigrams of different things, and you found it
inconvenient to keep typing the same five lines over and over. If you put the following into a file called
''trigram.sh'',

<pre>

</pre>

then you could count trigrams with a single line:

The shell script introduced several new symbols. The ''#'' symbol is used for comments. The ''$$''
syntax encodes a long number (the process id) into the names of the temporary files. It is a good idea to use
the ''$$'' syntax in this way so that two users (or two processes) can run the shell script at the same time,
and there won't be any confusion about which temporary file belongs to which process. (If you don't know
what a process is, don't worry about it. A process is a job, an instance of a program that is assigned
resources by the scheduler, the time sharing system.)
