<h3> Working with the virtual machine </h3>

<pre>
sudo apt-get update
</pre>

It will ask you for a password. The password is the same as the username. Note 
that when you type the password you won't see anything on the console. Just keep
typing and when you are finished press return ⏎.

<pre>
sudo apt-get install git
</pre>

This will install <tt>git</tt>. It will ask you if you want to continue. You need
to type <tt>Y</tt> and then press return ⏎.

<h3> Checking out your repository </h3>

First check out your repository, replace <tt>XXXXXX</tt> with your username on GitHub.

<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/XXXXXX/2017-osnov-programm.git
</pre>

Change directory into the repository you just cloned:

<pre>
$ cd 2017-osnov-programm
</pre>

And make three directories:

<pre>
$ mkdir corpus project homework
</pre>

The <tt>corpus</tt> directory will store your corpus so you don't lose it. The <tt>project</tt>
directory will be for your project work and the <tt>homework</tt> directory is for any 
homework you need to submit that isn't related to classwork.

<pre>
$ touch corpus/README.md project/README.md homework/README.md
</pre>

This <tt>touch</tt> command makes a new empty file called <tt>README.md</tt> in each of the
directories. We need to do this because <tt>git</tt> does not allow us to add empty directories.

<pre>
$ git add corpus project homework
</pre>

Here we add the directories that we have created to our <tt>git</tt> repository.

<pre>
$ git commit -a -m "Initialise stuff"
</pre>

And this "commits" them. Any time you make a change in your repository you should commit
the change.

Note that now you might need to do something extra like set your email address:

<pre>
$ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
</pre>

Where <tt>email@example.com</tt> is your email address.

<pre>
$ git push
</pre>

When you push, you send your local changes to the GitHub server. You will need to enter 
your username and password.


<h3> Navigating directories </h3>


<h3> Extracting your corpus </h3>



<h3> Adding your corpus to <tt>git</tt> </h3>

First check how big the corpus is. If it's more than a 2-3M then you want to make
a smaller corpus.
